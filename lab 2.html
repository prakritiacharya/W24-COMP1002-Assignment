    <h1>About me</h1>
    <H2>PRAKRITI ACHARYA</H2>
    <P>My name is Prakrit Acharya.I am from Nepal which is an asian country.I completed my high schooling last year with major in science.
        I recently moved to ontario, Cananda for my higher education.I enjoy reading either it's academic or outer topics.I embark the journey
        as an student, as it provide you with new oppourtunities and growth towards both your academic as well as personal factors.
            </P>
    <p>Beyond the academics,I find joy in listing to music, and i don't belive without it life would be same.Besides that, i enjoy travelling ,
        exploring, meeting new people as well. I also love scribbling on my notebooks most often, as I am involved in skeching and painting my
        surrounding as references, which i find as a refreshing break as well as a source for your creativity.I am in love with the colour green and blue 
        as it represents the colour of nature- (the greenery) and the sky which i always love to stare at.The intesting fact on this is i myself represent the nature i.e,
        the name of mine  solely means nature.
