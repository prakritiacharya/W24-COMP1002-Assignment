                    <p>First thing we'd climb a tree<br>
                        And maybe then we'd talk<br>
                        Or sit silently<br>
                        And listen to our thoughts<br>
                        With illusions of someday<br>
                        Cast in a golden light<br>
                        No dress rehearsal<br>
                        This is our life<br>
                        </p>
                         <p> that's where the hornet stung me<br>
                        And I had a feverish dream<br>
                        With revenge and doubt<br>
                        Tonight, we smoke them out</p>
                
                        <p> are ahead by a century<br>
                        You are ahead by a century<br>
                        You are ahead by a century</p>
                
                        <p>Stare in the morning shroud<br>
                        And then the day began<br>
                        I tilted your cloud<br>
                        You tilted my hand<br>
                        Rain falls in real time<br>
                        And rain fell through the night<br>
                        No dress rehearsal, this is our life</p>
                
                        <p>But that's when the hornet stung me<br>
                        And I had a serious dream<br>
                        With revenge and doubt<br>
                        Tonight, we smoked them out</p>
                
                       <p> You are ahead by a century<br>
                        You are ahead by a century<br>
                        You are ahead by a century</p>
