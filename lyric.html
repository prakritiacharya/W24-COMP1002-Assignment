      <p>First thing we'd climb a tree<br>
        And maybe then we'd talk<br>
        Or sit silently<br>
        And listen to our thoughts<br>
        With illusions of someday<br>
        Cast in a golden light<br>
        No dress rehearsal<br>
        This is our life<br>
        </p>
         <p> that's where the hornet stung me<br>
        And I had a feverish dream<br>
        With revenge and doubt<br>
        Tonight, we smoke them out</p>

        <p> are ahead by a century<br>
        You are ahead by a century<br>
        You are ahead by a century</p>

        <p>Stare in the morning shroud<br>
        And then the day began<br>
        I tilted your cloud<br>
        You tilted my hand<br>
        Rain falls in real time<br>
        And rain fell through the night<br>
        No dress rehearsal, this is our life</p>

        <p>But that's when the hornet stung me<br>
        And I had a serious dream<br>
        With revenge and doubt<br>
        Tonight, we smoked them out</p>

       <p> You are ahead by a century<br>
        You are ahead by a century<br>
        You are ahead by a century</p>
